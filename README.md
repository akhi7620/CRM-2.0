Features in Detail
1. User Authentication
Spring Security is used to manage login, registration, and user roles (Admin, User).

JWT (JSON Web Token) can be implemented for secure token-based authentication.

2. Contact Management
Users can add, update, and delete contacts from their dashboard.

Each contact can have a name, phone number, email, profile image, description, and category (e.g., Personal, Work).

3. Categories and Search
Contacts can be categorized to make management easier (Personal, Work, etc.).

Search functionality allows users to filter contacts by name or email.

Pagination is implemented to display contacts in chunks (for performance).

4. Image Upload
Users can upload profile images for their contacts.

Images are stored either locally on the server or uploaded to Cloudinary for cloud-based storage.

5. Email Notifications
Users receive an email notification whenever a new contact is added.

Future Enhancements
Mobile Application: Build a REST API and connect it with a mobile app.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Add an additional layer of security for user login.

SMS Notifications: Integrate Twilio for SMS notifications.

Activity Logging: Track user actions and display them in a history log.
