## Notable improvements I implemented
- Built a responsive Tailwind-based UI with custom design system (brand tokens, typography, container) â€” improved UI consistency and reduced CSS file size by using utility classes.
- Implemented persistent dark-mode toggle (localStorage + Tailwind dark class).
- Added accessibility fixes and keyboard-focus styles; raised Lighthouse accessibility score from X to Y.
- Added unit (Jest + Testing Library) and e2e tests (Playwright), integrated CI with GitHub Actions to run tests/lint on PRs.
- Integrated Tailwind plugins: typography, forms, aspect-ratio, line-clamp to improve content rendering and developer DX.
